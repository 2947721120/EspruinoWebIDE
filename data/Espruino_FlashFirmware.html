    <h3 class="EspruinoOption">Firmware Updates</h3>
    <div>
        <p><b>BETA:</b> be careful to choose the correct firmware for your device.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> currently this only flashes devices with the Espruino USB Bootloader (like the Espruino Board). 
        To put the board into bootloader mode, hold down BTN1 and then tap RST. The blue LED should start glowing. When this
        is done and you have connected the Web IDE, click the 'Write Firmware' button and wait. Flashing can take around
        5 minutes. When finished, the status in the top left will change and you can press the reset button on Espruino.</p>
